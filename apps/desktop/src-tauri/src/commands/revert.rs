//! Revert command — the "Undo last change" safety net.
//!
//! Before every chat turn, [`chat_send`](super::chat::chat_send) takes a
//! *studio checkpoint* (a git commit of the project as it stood just before the
//! AI touched it) and stashes it in [`AppState::checkpoints`]. `revert_last`
//! rolls the project back to that checkpoint: `git reset --hard <sha>` plus a
//! `git clean -fd` that removes AI-created untracked files while preserving the
//! studio's own state dir (`.unity-vibe/`).
//!
//! It refuses to run while a chat or auto-loop is active for the project (you
//! can't rewind under a live edit), and clears the checkpoint once reverted so
//! the button hides until the next turn.
