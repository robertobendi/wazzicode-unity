# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-20

- Version only: no C# changes. The package version is compared against the MCP server's
  `PRODUCT_VERSION` (`unity_diagnose_connection` → `unityPackage.matchesServer`), so it moves with
  the server release even when the Editor-side code is untouched. 0.6.0 adds the `machine` tool
  group, which drives Unity's own `unity` CLI from outside the Editor and needs nothing from this
  package.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-08-05

- Consolidate the per-file RPC param parsers (`Str`/`Int`/`GetInt`/`GetBool`/`GetFloat`/`TryFloat`, ~18 duplicate definitions across 10 handler files) into a shared `BridgeParams` static class, pulled in via `using static`; call sites unchanged (`BridgeRouter`'s `GetString`→`Str` and `BridgeServer`'s `GetParam*` renamed to the shared names). `GetBool` now uniformly tolerates string/number-encoded bools everywhere.
- `BridgeServer.DeleteDiscovery` now logs a warning when removing `bridge.json` fails (a stale discovery file makes clients dial a dead port and misreport `UNITY_RELOADING`).

- Add `screenshot.editorWindow` method / `unity_capture_editor_window` tool: captures the entire Editor main window (all docked panels) from the OS framebuffer via `InternalEditorUtility.ReadScreenPixel`, with optional `maxWidth` downscale. Distinct from the existing camera-render captures (game/scene/selected).
- Add `AutoSaveGuard`: in autonomous sessions, automatically persists dirty (already-on-disk) scenes just before an assembly/domain reload or entering play mode, so Unity's blocking "Scene(s) have been modified — save before reloading?" modal can never freeze an unattended loop. Gated to `safetyMode: "autopilot"` (or an explicit `"autoSaveBeforeReload": true` in `.unity-vibe/config.json`); interactive read-only/confirm sessions are unaffected, and untitled scenes are skipped to avoid a Save-As dialog.

## 0.1.0 — initial MVP
