/**
 * MCP tool annotations, tuned for Claude Code (the only client). Claude Code uses these hints to
 * decide what to surface and what it can run without a permission prompt:
 *   - readOnlyHint: this tool only observes — safe to auto-run.
 *   - destructiveHint: this write is hard to undo (overwrites a file, runs code, clears state).
 *   - idempotentHint: repeating it with the same args changes nothing further.
 *   - openWorldHint: it touches the network / outside world.
 * We derive them from each tool's write/writeTarget plus a few explicit overrides, so adding a tool
 * gets sensible defaults for free.
