# Unity manual test checklist

Unity Vibe OS's Unity Editor package (`unity/UnityVibeOS/`) **cannot be run from this build environment** (no Unity Editor available). The package is written against documented Unity Editor APIs and standard idioms, but until it has been installed in a real Unity project, runtime behavior is unverified.

This checklist enumerates every assertion that should be hand-verified inside Unity before claiming the bridge is fully working.

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer (URP, HDRP, or Built-in pipeline).
- A test Unity project with at least one scene and one prefab.
- The `UnityVibeOS` package installed (see `unity/UnityVibeOS/README.md`).

## 1. Package installs cleanly

- [ ] Open the project. No compile errors in the Console after the package compiles.
- [ ] `Window → Unity Vibe OS → Status` opens a dialog with port, uptime, buffer size, compile state.

## 2. Bridge auto-starts

- [ ] Console shows `[UnityVibeOS] bridge listening on http://127.0.0.1:38578/`.
- [ ] `curl http://127.0.0.1:38578/health` returns `{"status":"ok",...}` JSON.
- [ ] `uvibe doctor` (from outside Unity) reports `Unity bridge: ✓`.

## 3. `system.summary` / `unity_project_summary`

- [ ] `unity_project_summary` returns the project's real Unity version, render pipeline, input system, build target, and at least one package.

## 4. `scene.getOpenScenes` / `unity_get_open_scenes`

- [ ] With one scene loaded: response contains exactly one entry, correct path/name, `isLoaded:true`.
- [ ] After `Ctrl/Cmd-S` (no changes): `isDirty:false`. After modifying a transform without saving: `isDirty:true`.
- [ ] Open a second scene additively: response now contains two entries; `activeScene` reflects current active.

## 5. `scene.getHierarchy` / `unity_get_scene_hierarchy`

- [ ] In a scene with `/Main Camera` and `/Directional Light`: response includes both as roots, with `Camera` and `Light` in their `components` arrays.
- [ ] Add a nested object `/Gameplay/Player`: response shows `Gameplay` with `children: [{name: "Player", path: "/Gameplay/Player", ...}]`.
- [ ] `maxDepth=1` returns roots only with no children.
- [ ] `includeComponents=false` omits the components array.

## 6. `selection.inspect` / `unity_inspect_selected`

- [ ] No selection → `{ hasSelection: false }`.
- [ ] Select an object → `selected.path` matches the hierarchy path; `transform`, `components`, `tag`, `layer`, `prefab`, and serialized `fields` are populated.
- [ ] On a prefab instance → `prefab.isPrefabInstance: true`, `prefab.sourcePath` is the asset path.
- [ ] Add a `Missing Script` component → `components` includes one with `isMissingScript: true` and `warnings` mentions the missing slot.
- [ ] On a MonoBehaviour with serialized fields (int, float, string, Vector3, ObjectReference) → all values appear under `fields` with correct types.
- [ ] On a null `Transform` reference field → field value is `null`.
- [ ] On an assigned-then-deleted reference (still has fileId) → `{ referenceType: "Missing", name: null }`.

## 7. `console.getLogs` / `unity_get_console_logs`

- [ ] Emit `Debug.Log("hi")` from a MonoBehaviour after the package has loaded → response includes the log.
- [ ] Emit `Debug.LogWarning` / `Debug.LogError` → both appear with correct `type`.
- [ ] Logs emitted **before** the package loaded are **not** retained. (Documented limitation.)
- [ ] `level=warning_or_error` excludes plain logs.
- [ ] `limit=10` returns at most 10 entries.

## 8. `compile.status` / `unity_wait_for_compile`

- [ ] During an active recompile (introduce a deliberate edit) → `isCompiling: true`.
- [ ] After compile finishes with no errors → `isCompiling: false, hasErrors: false, errorCount: 0`.
- [ ] Introduce a syntax error → `errorCount >= 1`, `errors[]` includes the file/line/message.
- [ ] `unity_wait_for_compile` polls and returns when `isCompiling` flips to `false`.

## 9. Screenshots

- [ ] `unity_capture_game_view` returns a PNG that matches what would render through `Camera.main` at the requested size (default 1280×720).
- [ ] Open a saved PNG from `.unity-vibe/screenshots/` — colors, geometry, lighting all look correct.
- [ ] If no `Camera.main` and no other active Camera exist, `unity_capture_game_view` returns `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` with a useful suggestion.
- [ ] Pass `cameraPath: "/SecondaryCam"` — that camera renders, not Main.
- [ ] `unity_capture_scene_view` matches the visible Scene view (camera angle, gizmos visibility per Unity's editor settings).
- [ ] With no SceneView open, the call returns `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`.
- [ ] Select a prefab asset in the Project pane → `unity_capture_selected` returns the AssetPreview thumbnail (square, dark background).
- [ ] Select a runtime GameObject with renderers → response is a 3/4 angle render framing the bounds. No leftover `__UVibeCaptureCam__` remains in the hierarchy after the call (`HideAndDontSave` + `DestroyImmediate`).
- [ ] In Claude Code, after a screenshot tool call, the chat shows the image inline (multimodal content block) — not just a JSON blob.

## 10. Threading & lifecycle

- [ ] Issue 50 rapid `unity_get_open_scenes` calls. None hangs; Editor remains responsive.
- [ ] Trigger an assembly reload (e.g. modify a script). Bridge stops cleanly, then auto-starts again.
- [ ] Quit the Editor. No port remains bound (`lsof -i:38578` returns nothing).
- [ ] `Window → Unity Vibe OS → Restart Bridge` reopens the port without errors.

## 11. Failure paths

- [ ] Send a malformed JSON request → response is `{ok:false, error:{code:"MALFORMED_BRIDGE_RESPONSE"}}`.
- [ ] Send `{"id":"x","version":"1.0","method":"unknown"}` → `error.code: "INVALID_ARGUMENT"`.
- [ ] Hold the main thread artificially > 15s (debugger pause) → bridge returns `BRIDGE_TIMEOUT`.

## 12. End-to-end through Claude Code

- [ ] Configure Claude Code with the `mcp-config` snippet.
- [ ] In a fresh Claude Code session: `/mcp` shows `unity-vibe-os` as connected.
- [ ] Ask Claude "what is selected in Unity?" → it calls `unity_inspect_selected` and reports the right object.
- [ ] Ask Claude "are there any compile errors?" → it calls `unity_wait_for_compile` then `unity_get_console_logs`.
- [ ] Ask Claude "show me the game view" → it calls `unity_capture_game_view` and the rendered frame appears inline in chat.

## 13. Navigation / layout / prefab / play-test / 2D tools (newest milestone)

These ship in the bridge but their Unity-side behavior is **not** runtime-verified yet — validate each here. (For write tools, set `safetyMode` to `confirm`/`autopilot` and the matching `allow*` flag in `.unity-vibe/config.json`.)

- [ ] `unity_open_scene` with a clean editor → target scene becomes the only open scene; returns the open-scenes summary.
- [ ] `unity_open_scene` while a scene is dirty, no `discardUnsavedChanges` → `error.code: "UNSAVED_CHANGES"` listing the dirty scene(s); nothing is lost.
- [ ] `unity_open_scene` with `discardUnsavedChanges:true` → opens, abandoning the edits.
- [ ] `unity_load_scene_additive` → target scene is loaded alongside the existing scene(s).
- [ ] `unity_set_transform` (position/rotation/scale, local and world) → only the provided fields change; Undo (Ctrl+Z) reverts it.
- [ ] `unity_reparent` under a new parent, then to scene root; `worldPositionStays:false` keeps local values; self/descendant parent → `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- [ ] `unity_open_prefab` → enters prefab mode; `unity_set_serialized_field`/`unity_set_transform` then affect the prefab contents; `unity_save_prefab` writes the asset; `closeAfter:true` exits prefab mode.
- [ ] `unity_apply_prefab_instance` on a scene instance with overrides → overrides land on the source prefab; non-instance → `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- [ ] In play mode: `unity_simulate_input` with `<Keyboard>/space` (and a mouse button, and a gamepad axis) → the game reacts; outside play mode → `PLAY_MODE_REQUIRED`; no Input System package → `FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE`.
- [ ] In play mode: `unity_set_animator_parameter` (Bool/Float/Int and a Trigger) drives the Animator; `unity_get_animator_state` reports live layers/params; wrong type → `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- [ ] In edit mode: `unity_get_animator_state` returns the controller graph (layers/states/parameters/transitions).
- [ ] `unity_animator_edit_transition` sets duration/exitTime/conditions on an existing transition and (with `create:true`) adds a missing one; the `.controller` asset updates on disk.
- [ ] `unity_execute_menu_item` with a path in `allowedMenuItems` runs; a path not in the list → `MENU_ITEM_NOT_ALLOWED`; `allowMenuItems:false` → `SAFETY_MODE_BLOCKED`.
- [ ] `unity_import_asset` reimports a path; with `sourcePath` it copies an external file into `Assets/` first and a `.meta` is generated.
- [ ] `unity_slice_sprite` (by cell size and by column/row count) sets the importer to Sprite/Multiple and produces the expected sprite sub-assets.
- [ ] `unity_paint_tilemap` paints a tile across explicit cells and a `rect`; `erase:true` clears them; Undo reverts; no Tilemap component → `OBJECT_NOT_FOUND`.

## 14. Keep-awake (background processing while unfocused)

- [ ] With "Keep Unity Awake" ON (default; `Window ▸ Unity Vibe OS`, checkmark visible), click another app so Unity loses focus, then issue a bridge call (e.g. `unity_get_scene_hierarchy`) — it returns promptly without clicking back into Unity.
- [ ] Enter play mode, unfocus Unity → the game keeps running (frame count advances via `unity_get_play_mode_status`); with keep-awake OFF it pauses until refocused.
- [ ] Save a script while Unity is unfocused → compilation proceeds (with keep-awake ON) rather than waiting for focus.
- [ ] Toggle keep-awake OFF → unfocused tool calls become slow/stall until the window is clicked; toggle ON restores responsiveness. (Confirms the `Window ▸ Unity Vibe OS ▸ Keep Unity Awake` checkmark drives it.)
- [ ] Observe background CPU is modest while unfocused (a focused Editor is unaffected — the driver only ticks when in the background).

## What is NOT verified by this checklist

- The new navigation/layout/prefab/play-test/2D tools above until section 13 is completed in a real project — in particular `unity_simulate_input` (Input System reflection) and `unity_slice_sprite` (uses the legacy `TextureImporter.spritesheet` path) are the most likely to need per-version adjustment.
- Tests on Windows (the package is platform-agnostic but cross-OS HttpListener behavior should be re-verified on Windows specifically).
